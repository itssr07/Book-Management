This code is a React component for adding books to a management system. It utilizes React hooks like useState for managing form state, axios for making HTTP requests to the backend API, react-router-dom for navigation, and SweetAlert2 for displaying success and error messages. The component captures book details such as title, author, and published year through form inputs, validates and submits them to the backend API, then displays appropriate feedback to the user. The UI is structured using Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a responsive and visually appealing interface.
We can run this code using npm run dev.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
